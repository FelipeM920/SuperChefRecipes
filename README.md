# SuperChefRecipes

Obs: This project it's in very early stages, i'm creating this on mobile first, so open it on mobile resolution please.

UI/UX will be improved :)

How to run on localhost:

You'll need to generate an app_id and app_key for the Edaman api here: https://www.edamam.com/ (recipe Search API).

Insert your app_id and app_key on /search params in server.js

On app/superChefRecipes run build command to generate the project build on dist folder (npm run build).

On root folder start the node server (node server.js).

Node version: 18.12.0 (LTS)
